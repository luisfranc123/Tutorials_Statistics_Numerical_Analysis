# Tutorials_Statistics_Numerical_Analysis
Applied statistics and numerical analysis material

This repository contains sample material employed during Biostatistics class sessions to introduce students to statistical concepts and how to implement them in Python. Each Jupyter notebook includes both a theoretical background and its corresponding implementation, employing a case study accordingly.

Additionally, within the Numerical Methods folder, chapters corresponding to the textbook Python Programming and Numerical Methods (1) are developed in independent Jupiter notebooks. Each notebook contains a theoretical framework and the solution of proposed exercises by the authors.
