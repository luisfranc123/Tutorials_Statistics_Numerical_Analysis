        "The class is a blueprint to define a logical grouping of data and functions. It provides a way to create data structures that model real-world entities. For example, we can create a `people` class that contains the data such as name, age, and some behavior functions to print out ages and genders of a group of people. While class is the blueprint, an object is an `instance` of the class with actual values.\n",

Put it another way, a class is like a template to define the needed information, and an object is one specific copy that filled in the template. Also, objects instantiated from the same class are **independent** from each other. For example, if we have another person, say \"Batman\" with age 33, it can be instantiated from the `people` class, but it remains an independent instance.\n",

Note that this is convention and nothing stops you from actually accessing it. With double underscores, we can see that the attribute `__version` cannot be accessed or modiﬁed directly. To get access to the double underscore attributes, we need to use “getter” and “setter” functions to access it internally. A “getter” function is shown in the following example."
