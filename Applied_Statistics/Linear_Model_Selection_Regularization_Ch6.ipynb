As expected, the in-sample MSE improves each step we take, indicating we must use either the validation or cross-validation approach to select the number of steps. We fix the y-axis to range from 50,000 to 250,000 to compare the cross-validation and validation set MSE below, as well as other methods such as ridge regression, lasso and principal components regression."

To fit a *path* of ridge regression models, we use `skl.ElasticNet.path()`, which can fit both ridge and lasso, as well as a hybrid mixture; ridge regression corresponds to `l1_ratio = 0`- It is good practice to standardize the columns of `X` in these applications, if the variables are measured in different units. Since `skl.ElasticNet()` does no normalization, we have to take care of that ourselves. Since we standardize first, in order to find the coefficient estimates on the original scale, we must *unstandardize* the coefficient estimates. The parameter $\\lambda$ in $RSS + \\lambda\\sum_{j=1}^p{\\beta_j^2}$ and $RSS + \\lambda\\sum_{j=1}^p{|\\beta_j|}$, where $RSS = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{(y_i-\\beta_0-\\sum_{j = 1}^{p}{\\beta_jx_{ij}})}$, is called `alphas` in `sklearn`."

So here we have chosen to implement the function over a grid of values ranging from $\\lambda = 10^8$ to $\\lambda = 10^{-2}$ scaled by the standard deviation of $y$, essentially covering the full range of scenarios from the null model containing only the intercept, to the least squares fit.\n",

        "The ridge, lasso, and elastic net can be efficiently fit along a sequence of $\\lambda$ values, crating what is known as a *solution path* or *regularization path*. Hence there is a sepcialized code to fit such paths, and to choose a suitable value of $\\lambda$ using cross-validation. Even with identical splits the results will not agree *exactly* with our `grid` above because the standardization of each feature in `grid` is carried out on each fold, while in `pipeCV` below it is carried out only once. Nevertheless, the results are similar as the normalization is relatively stable across folds."

        "\n",
        "Choosing $\\lambda$ using cross-validation provides a single regression estimator, similar to fitting a linear regression model as we saw in Chapter 3. It is threfore reasonable to estimate what its test error is. We run into a problem here in that cross-validation will have *touched* all of its data in choosing $\\lambda$, hence we have no further data to estimate test error. A compromise is to do an initial split of the data into two disjoint sets: a trining set and a test set. We then fit a cross-validation tuned ridge regression on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the test set. We mooght call this cross-validation nested within the validation set approach. A priori there is no reason to use half of the data for each of the two sets in validation. Below, we use 75% for training and 25% for test, with the estimator being ridg regression tuned using 5-fold cross validation. This can be achieved i code as follows:"

We now ask whether the lasso can yield either a more accurate or a more interpretable model than ridge regression. In order to fit a lasso model, we once again use the `ElasticNetCV()` function; however, this time we use the argument `l1_ratio = 1`. Other than that, we proceed just as we did in fitting a ridge model."
